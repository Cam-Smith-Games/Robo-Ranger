more for like a platformer type of game

shoot a disc up in the area, get the right amount of distance and angle between you
press space to catapult yourself across the screen

kinda like a cooler version of angry birds and can involve something besides knocking shit down 
(maybe you have to land on a platform and do something else idk)
