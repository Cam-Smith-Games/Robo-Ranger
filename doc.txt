ROBO RANGER: Zarthelon's Throne

i learned how to make the basic game engine from Edward Herberts html5 game development tutorial found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-anNiDwHS0 
(I watched like the first 5 episodes and it taught me how to make a square move on a canvas with arrow keys)
everything else was completely by me and w3schools (occasionally stackoverflow). 

due to the silliness of having different stages on different webpages, avoid pressing back (when restarting you either have to close browser or press M (my cheat code) to reset session storage)

-> intro screen

-> starting field
field is connected to forest and castle courtyard

-> forest
forest connected to test room and field

-> test room 
test room only connected to forest
has chest with gun in it

-> castle courtyard
has a guard you have to talk to before entering next room

-> throne room 
kill boss, win game

I contacted matthew pablo and he allowed me to use the free music from his website at http://www.matthewpablo.com/
